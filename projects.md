# Projects

There were 42 unique gestures that were created across all eleven projects. Some gestures were common amongst projects (ex: _run_ and _jump_) and others were unique only to one project. For anonymity, the child's name is replaced with the of their stuffed animal (ex: Cat, Dog, Unicorn). Since multiple children brought teddy bears, their names start with the name they gave to their stuffed animal followed by bear (ex: Brian Bear, John Bear).

In the following visualization, each gesture is listed next to a circle. The circle size corresponds to the number of times that gesture was used across all stuffed animal projects. For instance, _run_ was used more often than _fly_. To see which stuffed animals used each gesture, hover over the gesture name to reveal the stuffed animals associated with it (each stuffed animal's name corresponds to its own color) and what other gestures were also used.

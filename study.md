# The Study
PlushPal was introduced to eleven kids, ages 8-14 years old, over Zoom and in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children brought their own stuffed animals to the playtest and used a micro:bit and PlushPal to make their toys interactive. After a brief introduction to the tool, machine learning, and a presurvey, children were asked to make custom gestures for their stuffed animals (ex. walking, eating, sleeping). These gestures were performed multiple times by the children, and it was suggested that they should perform and record each gesture at least three times.

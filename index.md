# What is PlushPal?
[PlushPal](https://ttseng.github.io/plushie/) is a new digital tool for kids to use make their stuffed animals interactive using machine learning (ML). Kids make their own custom gesture and sound pairings, and use a [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) to detect specific movements that their stuffed animals make.

Start by attaching a micro:bit to a stuffed animal and pair it to PlushPal using web Bluetooth.

### Record Gestures

Create a new gesture and perform the gesture multiple times while recording it.

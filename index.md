# PlushPal Study

## What is PlushPal?
[PlushPal](https://ttseng.github.io/plushie/) is a new digital tool for kids to use make their stuffed animals interactive using machine learning (ML). Kids make their own custom gesture and sound pairings, and use a [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) to detect specific movements that their stuffed animal makes.

### Record Gestures
Create a new gesture and perform the gesture multiple times while recording it.

### Evaluate and Play
Test if ML models correctly detect gestures and make adjustments as needed and add sound to each gesture.

## What is the PlushPal study?
PlushPal was introduced to eleven kids, ages 8-14 years old, over Zoom and in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children brought their own stuffed animals to the playtest and used a micro:bit and PlushPal to make their toys interactive. After a brief introduction to the tool, machine learning, and a presurvey, children were asked to make asked to make create custom gestures for their stuffed animals (ex. walking, eating, sleeping). These gestures were performed multiple times by the children, and it was suggested that they should perform and record each gesture at least three times.
